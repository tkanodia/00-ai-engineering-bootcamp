The joints are very stiff at first but loosen up a bit once you get it started. The base is heavy enough to keep it planted in place while using it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Works well Works well\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Very stable, strong, and versatile laptop riser Wow, this thing is built well! I love that it can be adjusted to many different heights and angles. After you have the height  and angle right, you can easily pivot/rotate it on the base. There is also a satisfying clicking  sound when rotating it. The dark pewter color also looks pretty nice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is rather difficult to muscle the height and angle adjustments. The joints are very stiff. This is good because it won\\'t move over time under the weight of the laptop and gravity, but was really hard to get it adjusted. I supposed having axles that you could loosen and then tighten may fix the issue. Luckily, I\\'ve got it all adjusted now, and barely need to change it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: It’s sturdy I love it hold up my MacBook\\n- ID: B0C3XYD574, review: Buena Solo tiene usándola unos días calidad precio excelente la pantalla se ve muy bien la batería su durabilidad es buena y el protector es resistente, me gusto.\\n', name='get_formatted_reviews_context', tool_call_id='call_0'), AIMessage(content='Here are some kids electronics and a laptop accessory, along with user feedback on their durability:\\n\\nKids Electronics:\\n1.

The joints are very stiff at first but loosen up a bit once you get it started. The base is heavy enough to keep it planted in place while using it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Works well Works well\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Very stable, strong, and versatile laptop riser Wow, this thing is built well! I love that it can be adjusted to many different heights and angles. After you have the height  and angle right, you can easily pivot/rotate it on the base. There is also a satisfying clicking  sound when rotating it. The dark pewter color also looks pretty nice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is rather difficult to muscle the height and angle adjustments. The joints are very stiff. This is good because it won\\'t move over time under the weight of the laptop and gravity, but was really hard to get it adjusted. I supposed having axles that you could loosen and then tighten may fix the issue. Luckily, I\\'ve got it all adjusted now, and barely need to change it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: It’s sturdy I love it hold up my MacBook\\n- ID: B0C3XYD574, review: Buena Solo tiene usándola unos días calidad precio excelente la pantalla se ve muy bien la batería su durabilidad es buena y el protector es resistente, me gusto.\\n', name='get_formatted_reviews_context', tool_call_id='call_0'), AIMessage(content='Here are some kids electronics and a laptop accessory, along with user feedback on their durability:\\n\\nKids Electronics:\\n1.

I have reviewed several 360° flexible laptop stands.  And. THIS is the sturdiest of them all!<br /><br />Yeah, it\\'s as stiff as heck.  But, this is all part of handing heavier loads.  Unless you anticipate constantly adjust the stand, you may want to invest another stand.  But, sturdiness will be compromised.<br /><br />I use this stand with my 15\" MacBook Pro to make use of its monitor ergonomically while extending to a 34\" ultrawide monitor.\\n- ID: B0C3XYD574, review: Easy set up & very durable!

The joints are very stiff at first but loosen up a bit once you get it started. The base is heavy enough to keep it planted in place while using it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Works well Works well\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: Very stable, strong, and versatile laptop riser Wow, this thing is built well! I love that it can be adjusted to many different heights and angles. After you have the height  and angle right, you can easily pivot/rotate it on the base. There is also a satisfying clicking  sound when rotating it. The dark pewter color also looks pretty nice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is rather difficult to muscle the height and angle adjustments. The joints are very stiff. This is good because it won\\'t move over time under the weight of the laptop and gravity, but was really hard to get it adjusted. I supposed having axles that you could loosen and then tighten may fix the issue. Luckily, I\\'ve got it all adjusted now, and barely need to change it.\\n- ID: B0BML99MQ3, review: It’s sturdy I love it hold up my MacBook\\n- ID: B0C3XYD574, review: Buena Solo tiene usándola unos días calidad precio excelente la pantalla se ve muy bien la batería su durabilidad es buena y el protector es resistente, me gusto.\\n', name='get_formatted_reviews_context', tool_call_id='call_0'), AIMessage(content='Here are some kids electronics and a laptop accessory, along with user feedback on their durability:\\n\\nKids Electronics:\\n1.
